Effective February 15, 2018, NYU has adopted a [Website Accessibility Policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/website-accessibility.html)
that requires NYU websites and content to be accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. This aligns with NYU’s commitment to inclusion, and with federal regulations and standards.

NYU is committed to supporting an information technology environment that provides individuals who have a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight or cognitive abilities the opportunity to participate in University programs, benefits and services. NYU’s commitment to digital accessibility is grounded not only in principles of equity and inclusion, but also with
the knowledge that accessible digital content generally enhances usability for everyone.

The Website Accessibility Policy covers websites and content across NYU: www.nyu.edu, schools/departments, libraries, administrative units, and institutes/centers - any website that is used to conduct University business, scholarship, education, and research. For more information about the policy and about accessibility more generally at NYU, visit the [NYU
Digital Accessibility](https://www.nyu.edu/it/accessibility) site for details including:

   - FAQs for web developers, content creators, and faculty
   - A checklist of Top 10 Accessibility considerations
   - Background information on accessibility
   - Training opportunities
   - Step-by-step instructions for making documents accessible
   - Procedures with timelines, responsibilities, and procurement assistance

The Digital Accessibility Program team is working closely with Schools, Libraries, and other units - as well as Public Affairs for the main NYU website - and is conducting accessibility audits to provide information to the distributed web developers and authors across NYU. The team is available to speak at department, faculty, or special interest group
meetings.
